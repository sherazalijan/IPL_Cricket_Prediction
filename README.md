IPL Cricket Prediction üèè
Overview
The IPL Cricket Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict match outcomes with remarkable accuracy (99%). Using historical IPL match and delivery data, this model analyzes key features such as team composition, venue, toss outcome, and player performance to forecast results. This project demonstrates the integration of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment in Python using Streamlit.
